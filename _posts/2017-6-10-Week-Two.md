### What did you do this past week?

This past week, I started the first project, an experiment with the Collatz Conjecture. I'm still working to improve my speeds, experimenting with smaller caches and a few other tricks. Though I've done a similar project before, this project has also been valuable in getting familiar with Python syntax.

### What's in your way?

Time. Juggling preparation for this class, eventual group work, a few large unexpected conflicts, and other such tidbits becomes a challenge, but there is some fun in the mayhem. 

### What will you do next week?

Once I get my bearings, I look forward to working with a group towards the new project! I want to start researching and familiarizing myself with some of the tools we will use beforehand, as I expect the next few weeks to require a lot of planning and hard, concentrated work and focus. 

### What's my experience of the class?

The flow of the class, from being given a problem to setting up an environment appropriate for the project, felt familiar to past work internships. Setting up the environment wasn't difficult as there wasn't much to set up for this project, but I expect upcoming projects to be much more varied. I unfortunately missed Friday's class, so I missed valuable information about metacaching, lazy caching, and eager caching, but I remember enough from Dr. Downing's OOP class to implement those optimizations. I'll be vigilant about not missing another day, however.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

A tool I found valuable in optimizing my Collatz submission was using Python Profilers to examine where most of the computation time was occuring in my program, which function was my bottleneck. It can be very easy to get started with, and the official Python documentation details how to do so here: <https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html />.
