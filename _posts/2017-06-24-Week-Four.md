### What did you do this past week?

The majority of this week was spent preparing for the first test, which we take on Monday. Regarding the project, we established roles for the next Phase, refined our model, and brainstormed the implementation of our API.

### What's in your way?

External conflicts such as other classes continue to make scheduling much more difficult. However, by the end of next week, I will be freed up to focus on this course. Beyond that, thanks to better planning and management of time, nothing is in my way enough to mention.

### What will you do next week?

Next week, my group intends to finish Phase 2. I plan to work primarily on the backend, specifically with regards to the database, implementation of the API, etc.

### What's my experience of the class?

We learned some interesting mechanics of Python. While continuing our look into iterators and specifically generators, we learned how to use yield to section the work done by an iterator. Speaking of which, it may be valuable for younger students to know that implemntation of iterators have appeared in mumerous interviews. It would be to their benefit to pay close attention to the mechanics of a language like Python and the intentions/motivations of the designers.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

For students looking for interviews, try using Handshake, a service by which CNS students can search for jobs, internships, etc. It's not a long process and may be worth your while, as internships are wonderfully valuable in getting a feel for industry work and developing your resume. To further convince you, I remind you that Dr. Downing started the class with: "Welcome to the class. First of all, what the heck are you all doing here? You should be doing internships!" or something along those lines.

For students preparing for interviews, try LeetCode. It's similar to HackerRank, with an array of problems in various languages to test your algorithmic ability. Try doing each problem in ~20 min. It has helped me significantly in preparing me for interviews.
