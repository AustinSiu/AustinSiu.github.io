### What did you do this past week?

Work began on Phase 1 of our semester project. After finding a group and sifting through ideas like US branches of government and their employees, endangered animals, and sports, we've decided to develop a site that caters to players of the video game Overwatch. 

### What's in your way?

Time is a scarce resource, especially for me in light of other courses I'm taking simultaneously. With tests and projects due each week, I'm finding it a rewarding challenge when I manage my time well.

Getting adjusted to backend technologies and the infrastruture of a website is a fun project, but the unfamiliarity has definitely caused me to waste more hours than otherwise. A recommendation to future potential students is to set aside time for your project once you receive the assignment, not when you meet with your group to start.

### What will you do next week?

I will spend the majority of my time preparing for tests in my various classes, while working on Phase 2 in between study session.

### What's my experience of the class?

Valuable, when determined to learn. I've found my time in class more rewarding after recently deciding to follow it with review of Dr. Downing's notes on Github and the excercises he goes through before the next class. It's valuable for both retaining knowledge and doing well on the daily quizes.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Hofstadter's law is a valuable adage that I heard a few months ago. Coined by Professor Douglas Hofstadter, it states:

"It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."

We students may find this humurous, but I've also found it a valuable reminder of the importance of planning, of preparing for misfortune, and accounting for the unknown in life. Many setbacks in my college and professional career can be attributed to lack of proper preparation, over-confidence, or lack of information. My advice, then, is to be humble, be open to learning, and be ready for anything to the best of your ability.
