title: Week 1: An Introduction
---

### Expectations

I expect to about and develop a working knowledge of the many development tools we will learn about, such as AWS, PostgreSQL, etc. I am looking forward to learning Python and building with it. The software design practices will be very valuable as well. Overall, excited for the semester.

### What did you do this past week?

Dr. Downing covered the syllabus and expectations for the class. We began diving into learning Python, setting up Docker images to build sharable developer environments, and had a brief glimpse at Project 1 through the Collatz Conjecture.

### What's in your way?

Many of the technologies we will learn through this class are new to me, which is likely expected of students, but is nevertheless intimidating. Despite that, I'm excited to start learning them and be able to kickstart my first job.

### What will you do next week?

Beyond finishing the readings and preparing to finish Project 1, I want to continue learning what tools and skills I'll need for the software developer exerience. I've been exposed to it from internships, but I feel I still have much to learn if I want to hit the ground running at my first job.

### What's my experience of the class?

Class went as expected, especially after I've taken Object-Oriented Programming with Dr. Downing. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I found an article/post about customizing your terminal to improve your experience a while back, and figured it was relevant to software development. Found at "http://mikebuss.com/2014/02/02/a-beautiful-productive-terminal-experience", the author details various tools that make development easier, from small things like better completion handling and spelling correction in terminal to plugins for git that detail information about the local and remote branches.
