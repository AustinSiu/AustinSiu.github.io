### What did you do this past week?

This past week I've been catching up on and reviewing more recent assigned readings, especially Refactoring by Martin Fowler, for the most part.

### What's in your way?

In wrapping up the course project, I need to help prepare the presentation of our website, overwatchdb.me. More nervewracking is the approaching final, which is about a week away from tomorrow.

### What will you do next week?

With my team, I'll prepare for the website presentation. I'll start seriously preparing for the second exam by reviewing texts and writing small programs to play with the techniques that we've learned thus far.

### What's my experience of the class?

My impression of the class remains the same as usual.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I was reading an article by a Software Development Manager at Amazon that I thought was applicable to this class. In said article, found at <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hard-thing-software-development-jesse-watson>, the author explains the necessity of understanding the business problem at a deep level for software developers today.

The author argues that "communication, internalization, and synthesis of ideas is the hard part (in developing software), not technology." Prof. Downing has pushed a similar idea onto us students through the writing of these blogs, the use of team communication tools like Slack, and writing documentation for other devs as seen in Apiary and tech reports. There's also the notion of taking the business problem and interpreting the often vague instructions that I feel was shown to us in the project phase specs, which listed functionality to implement and some tools, but no more.

One of the large points of the article could be summarized as such: "My submission is that a developer's value to their employer or customer is almost directly proportional to the depth and breadth of their deep contextâ€”the knowledge that they have internalized and synthesized in their business's problem domain." This is something that, in my opinion, very valuable for us taking this course with hopes of working as a software developer. The deeper understanding of the customer's needs and wants and the ability to translate that into a set of assumptions and designs are qualities I've seen in the more respected developers and project managers at previous internships, which leads me to support the author's observation.

Given some of the overlaps between our class' objective, and the domain of the observatioins noted by the author, I thought it was a valuable read and would encourage fellow students to give it at least a quick read.
