The final test is tomorrow, and after that, the class is over. I think the class has been a valuable one to take before graduation, and I want to share a few of my thoughts as to why.

As a note to future students, I think that CS 373: Software Engineering will be a course from which you get what you put in. That goes for any class, but especially so for this class in my opinion. The reason I say this is that much of what you learn in class and are tested over does not overlap with the majority of work in the class, which lies in the projects. You can pass the class producing a minimal effort on the projects, with little to no care for the performance or aesthetic of the site beyond what gets you points on a rubric. However, you'll be missing out on what I think is one of the greatest benefits in this class, which is Prof. Downing twisting your arm into making a project that you can put on your resume.

The class project is a decently large project for a student, and as he explicitly tells us, Prof. Downing forces a great many software tools upon you for many reasons, such as getting you used to learning new tools on the job and popular tools in the current web industry. Those are both great reasons to work hard and make a good website as a result. There's also the benefit of having a lot of buzzwords that recruiters will like on your resume, which helps you get those interviews, but you won't get past those if you don't put in the work to back your resume up.

In conclusion, this has been a rewarding semester, and I'd recommend it to other students interested in working in industry, especially as a Full Stack Developer or the like.
